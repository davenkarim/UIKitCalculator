# ðŸ§® Calculator

## ðŸ“˜ About This Project

This calculator project was built as part of my iOS development journey through *The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp* by Angela Yu on Udemy. The primary focus of this project is mastering Auto Layout and building responsive user interfaces that adapt to different device orientations and screen sizes.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced

During the development of this app, I applied several important iOS layout techniques:

* Using **Auto Layout** to make UI flexible and responsive
* Working with **Size Classes** for orientation-based layouts
* Setting **Constraints with Safe Areas**
* Utilizing **Stack Views** for consistent element distribution
* **Aligning and pinning UI elements**
* **Nesting Containers and Subviews** for better layout management

## ðŸ“± App Interface

The calculator interface is designed to dynamically adapt between portrait and landscape modes using stack views and layout constraints.

### ðŸ“² Portrait Mode

### ðŸŒ„ Landscape Mode

## ðŸŽ“ What I Learned

* Creating adaptive layouts that follow platform guidelines
* Debugging and adjusting conflicting constraints
* Making interfaces that are usable and visually consistent across orientations
* Handling spacing and proportions with layout priorities
* Using nested stack views effectively

## âœ… Conclusion

This project sharpened my skills in iOS UI development and taught me how to think in terms of responsive design. Building the calculator from scratch without hardcoding layouts was a rewarding challenge, and it gave me confidence to build more complex and scalable interfaces in the future.
